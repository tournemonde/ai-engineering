"""Request and response models for the estimation endpoint.

Session 4 contract: typed form-style request maps to a typed, validated
``EstimationResult`` (structured output via Instructor + Pydantic). Two model
validators enforce business rules that the LLM cannot break:

1. The cost of all phases must sum to ``total_cost_eur``.
2. Low-confidence answers (< 30%) must declare it explicitly by starting the
   summary with ``"Out of scope:"``.

When the LLM violates a validator, Instructor re-prompts the model with the
``ValueError`` message until it agrees (up to ``max_retries`` attempts).
