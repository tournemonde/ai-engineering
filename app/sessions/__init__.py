"""Session 5 — conversational memory.

Two structures, separated on purpose:

- ``ConversationHistory`` is the rolling array of ``messages`` sent to the LLM
  every turn. It implements a sliding window: when ``MAX_TURNS`` is exceeded,
  the oldest pairs are dropped.
- ``ProjectMetadata`` captures the *facts* of the project under discussion
  (name, team, technologies, agreed scope). It lives outside the history and
  is injected into the system prompt every turn — that's how the model
  remembers context that would otherwise be evicted by the sliding window.

The ``Session`` owns both, plus a ``session_id`` and a creation timestamp. A
``SessionStore`` holds them in a plain ``dict`` keyed by ``session_id``.
Volatility (state lost on process restart) is intentional for this phase —
persistence is module-3 work.
